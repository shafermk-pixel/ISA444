The purpose of this project was to build and evaluate a working forecasting application using real hotel demand data, which I accomplished by creating a Hugging Face Spaces app that allows users to upload a dataset, configure forecasting settings, run classical models, and export evaluation metrics, cross-validation results, and forward forecasts. For my analysis, I focused on hotel_0 from the sample_hotels dataset and generated a 14-day forecast using the Naive model, chosen as a simple and transparent performance benchmark that predicts each future value as the most recent observation. After loading hotels_input.csv, I configured a fixed-window evaluation strategy with a 14-day backtest horizon, 7-day step size, 3 windows, and a 14-day forecast horizon, activating only the Naive model for clarity and speed. Running the model produced a dense backtesting plot due to multiple hotels, confirming successful computation across all unique_ids, and evaluation metrics showed minimal bias—for instance, hotel_0 had a bias of about 0.0326, indicating a slight over-forecast. Cross-validation tables displayed actual versus predicted values, with hotel_0’s predictions repeating the last observed value (0.691358) during the backtest window. The future 14-day forecast behaved as expected, assigning the most recent value (e.g., 0.82716 beginning July 1, 2023) to all forecasted dates. Overall, the application successfully loaded data, executed the Naive model, generated evaluation outputs, and produced interpretable forecasts, demonstrating a fully functioning ISA444 forecasting pipeline.
